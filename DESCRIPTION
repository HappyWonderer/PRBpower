Description: Using data from a parent clinical trial, this program computes the power of a 
 Prospective-Retrospective Biomarker (PRB) study in which the null hypothesis is that the
 treatment hazard ratio among the marker-positive subjects is equal to the treatment hazard 
 ratio among the marker-negative subjects.
