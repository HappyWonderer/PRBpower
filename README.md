The goal of PRBpower is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of PRBpower from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("HappyWonderer/PRBpower")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(PRBpower)
# Example will be available in a future VERSION.
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
